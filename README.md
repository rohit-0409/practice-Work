So, to practice HTML and CSS i asking chatGPT to generate me simple simple web pages like **Login-Page,Registration-Page,Home-Page** to use them as reference.

But now found this awesome website "iCodeThis" and it has like so many simple web pages with codes.

Now, I'm using this site to for reference material to practice my HTML & CSS.

Don't ask me why im writing this here.
