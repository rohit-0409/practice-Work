# practice-Work
A collection of coding projects and exercises I'm working on to improve my skills. Includes everything from basic algorithms to simple web stuff.

All of the projects here are referenced from this site **https://icodethis.com/**. No i havent looked at their codes for once.

I use chatGPT but thats for like "Why yours working and mine isnt" / "Why this way and not this way".

So, to practice HTML and CSS i asking chatGPT to generate me simple simple web pages like **Login-Page,Registration-Page,Home-Page** to use them as reference.

But now found this awesome website "iCodeThis" and it has like so many simple web pages with codes.

Now, I'm using this site to for reference material to practice my HTML & CSS.

Don't ask me why im writing this here.

- So far have used C#,c,Python,Java,lua but HTML and CSS felt the most stupid.

 - Havent touched Js yet. Maybe after 2-3 more projects as im getting kind off comfortable with HTML and CSS.

I know whats i'm doin instead of just making things work out thats how i made things before but i do understand what should be done and how it should be.

Tho im still bad at scalling/positioning, need to work on that part.
