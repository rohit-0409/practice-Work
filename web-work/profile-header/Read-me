I'm not creating anything complex cuz i just started to get use to of the syntax and properties and started to understand that you need to structure the site with HTML and not just put anything inside a random dev.

Few more projects before mobing to js and most probably js would be easy for me. I have seen codes and those made sense more than HTML and CSS.
