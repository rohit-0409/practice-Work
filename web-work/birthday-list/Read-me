Im getting the gist of css and its properties.

This was easy to make like didnt take much of brainstorming and basically i knew this time how this could be made.

Took like <30 mins, no i dont wanna hear that you can make it in 5 mins.

This time i didnt just made things to work out somehow like previously i use to have fixed values like px which was on shrinking the tab makes everything spill out the wrapper.

But this time i knew this how thing should be structured in HTML and things are looking good nothing spilling out off of the wrapper.
